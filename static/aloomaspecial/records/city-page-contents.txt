Choosing the Right Portable Restroom<h2>
Choosing the right porta-potty starts with understanding your crowd, your timeline, and your setup:<list>
Know your headcount. Use the industry rule of one unit per 50 attendees for events or per 10 workers on job sites.^^
Consider accessibility. If your event is open to the public, at least one ADA-compliant unit is usually required.^^
Think about duration. Events longer than 6 hours or multi-day jobs need cleaning service built into the schedule.^^
Evaluate the setting. Weddings or VIP events benefit from luxury restroom trailers with climate control and interior lighting.^^
Don’t forget hand hygiene. Add handwashing stations or flushable models for food-related events or child-friendly setups.
